# Intro

Machine should be able to talk to each other like we humans do,  So there should be a language between machines. 

OK, at  this stage this project is just for fun, but It have potential. I really think it's necessary like in the scenario that C3PO talk to hyperdrive.

like this:

> hyper: hello there!
>
> c3po:  Hi, what a tense situation we got, hope we got out soon.
>
> hyper: Just so you know, I got broken wire, I think we are stuck here.
>
> c3po: whaaaaat...

definitely not this:

> hyper:  wire error!!!
>
> hyper:  wire error!!!
>
> hyper:  wire error!!!
>
> c3po: Uh oh...



 Http is kind of suit for the idea, But we software engineer make our own wheel.
